    <p>ike most other male mammals, a man's genome <br> usually inherits an X chromosome from the mother and a
         Y <br> chromosome from the father. T
        he male fetus produces larger amounts of androgens and smaller amounts of estrogens 
        than a female fetus. This difference in the relative amounts of these sex steroids is responsible for the physiological differences 
        that distinguish men from women.</p>
